# Lives:
# By default, you will start with 1 life and can get up to 10.
# water value determines if water will spawn. (can be true or false)
# Could be set to false if you wanted to start with 10 life and see how far you could get.
# Would not recommend more than 20 lives, or you will get in to graphical glitches.
# Default spawn rate for water is everny 10000 milliseconds. This can be changed by modifying lives_spawn_rate

# Enemies:
# Spawn rate determines how often enemies spawn. (default it every 250 milliseconds)
# level_up can be either true or false. If level up is true, enemies will spawn 50 milliseconds quicker each level up.
# The 50 milliseconds is determined by the spawn_increase value.
# If level_up is true, the levelup_1 and 2 are the amount of points you need to level it up.
# The max speed and min speeds are the speeds that the fireballs can travel at.
# Will randomly choose a number between those numbers.
