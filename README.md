# First attempt at making a python game
Followed [this Guide](https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/), then added my own little extras to it.

The idea of the game it to avoid the fireballs and get as high score as you can.

* Arrow keys to move
* Space to restart
* Return to show help page (return again to close)
* Escape to close the game

## Extra features added
**Extra features include:**
* Different sprites
* Sprites have animations
* You can press space to restart
* It keeps track of your score
* Score increases when a fireball hits the left hand side of the screen
* Added gems, these also give you score. Different gems give different scores
* Gems as spawned at different frequencies depending on value
* It saves your score to a file, and at the end, will display the top five in that file
* Has a life system and displays that as hearts
* You can collect water droplets to increase your life
* Has a starting splash screen
* If you press enter, it will display more info about the objects in the
* Added code to read sprite sheets
* Converting some of the images to sprite sheets, rather than lost of separate files
* Update the text with the game font
* Final scores also now in game font, pulling from a number sprite sheet
